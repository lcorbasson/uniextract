; Translation Instructions:
;	Copy this file to a new file named after the new language
;		Eg: A language file for the German language would be named German.ini.
;	Replace the English words and phrases with their native equivalents,
;		attempting to match the English phrasing and case-sensitivity as
;		closely as possible for the sake of consistency
;	Update the Author and Homepage information at the top of your new language
;		file.  Simply delete the Homepage line if you don't have one.
;	Save the file in Unicode format (UTF-16) and Zip it to preserve formatting
;	E-mail new language files to jbreland@legroom.net for inclusion in main
;		Universal Extractor installer
;
;	The following symbols have special meanings:
;	& - when used in a GUI label or button, it precedes the letter that will
;		be registered as a "hotkey" for that function
;	%n - indicates a newline character, which will be replaced when displayed
;	%t - indicates a tab character, which will be replaced when displayed
;	%s - indicates a string variable that UniExtract will replace when displayed
;		The contents of each %s variable is hardocded into UniExtract.
;		The order and number of %s variables is very important and should not
;		be modified.
